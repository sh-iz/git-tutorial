# __Working with local repositories__

> ## **git init**

This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. This is the first step in creating a repository. After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.

### Command Line

``` bash
# change directory to codebase
$ cd /file/path/to/code

# make directory a git repository
$ git init
```
---

> ## **git add**


Adds files in the to the staging area for Git. Before a file is available to commit to a repository, the file needs to be added to the Git index (staging area). There are a few different ways to use git add, by adding entire directories, specific files, or all unstaged files.

### Command Line

``` bash
$ git add <file or directory name>

```
---
 > ## **git commit**

 Record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference, each commit has a unique ID.

It’s best practice to include a message with each commit explaining the changes made in a commit. Adding a commit message helps to find a particular change or understanding the changes.

### Command Line

```bash 
# Adding a commit with message
$ git commit -m "Commit message in quotes"
```
---

> ## **git status**

This command returns the current state of the repository.

git status will return the current working branch. If a file is in the staging area, but not committed, it shows with git status. Or, if there are no changes it’ll return nothing to commit, working directory clean.

```bash
$ git status
```

> ## git config

With Git, there are many configurations and settings possible. git config is how to assign these settings. Two important settings are user user.name and user.email. These values set what email address and name commits will be from on a local computer. With git config, a --global flag is used to write the settings to all repositories on a computer. Without a --global flag settings will only apply to the current repository that you are currently in.

There are many other variables available to edit in git config. From editing color outputs to changing the behavior of git status. Learn about git config settings in the official Git documentation.

### Command Line

```bash
$ git config <setting> <command>
```
---

> ## **git branch**
To determine what branch the local repository is on, add a new branch, or delete a branch.

### Command line

```bash
# Create a new branch
$ git branch <branch_name>

# List all remote or local branches
$ git branch -a

# Delete a branch
$ git branch -d <branch_name>
```
---

> ## **git checkout**
To start working in a different branch, use git checkout to switch branches.

### Command Line

```bash
# Checkout an existing branch
$ git checkout <branch_name>

# Checkout and create a new branch with that name
$ git checkout -b <new_branch>
```
---

> ## **git merge**

Integrate branches together. git merge combines the changes from one branch to another branch. For example, merge the changes made in a staging branch into the stable branch.

### Command Line
```bash
# Merge changes into current branch
$ git merge <branch_name>
```
---
# Working with remote repositories

> ## **git remote**
To connect a local repository with a remote repository. A remote repository can have a name set to avoid having to remember the URL of the repository.

### Command Line
 ```bash
# Add remote repository
$ git remote <command> <remote_name> <remote_URL>

# List named remote repositories
$ git remote -v
```
---

> ## **git clone**

To create a local working copy of an existing remote repository, use git clone to copy and download the repository to a computer. Cloning is the equivalent of git init when working with a remote repository. Git will create a directory locally with all files and repository history.

### Command Line
```bash
$ git clone <remote_URL>
```
---

> ## **git pull**
To get the latest version of a repository run git pull. This pulls the changes from the remote repository to the local computer.

### Command Line

```bash
$ git pull <branch_name> <remote_URL/remote_name>
```
---
>## **git push**
Sends local commits to the remote repository. git push requires two parameters: the remote repository and the branch that the push is for.


### Command Line
```bash
$ git push <remote_URL/remote_name> <branch>

# Push all local branches to remote repository
$ git push —all
```
